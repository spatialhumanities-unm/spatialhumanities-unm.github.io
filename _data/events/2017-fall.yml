    This brief chapter explores some of the ways a mega-engineering railroad project precipitated change throughout the environments of the Keys islands, arguing that its main impact lay in spurring new imaginaries of the Keys as environments, as islands, as a region, and as a demarcated geopolitical space.

    Today we'll discuss a rather old, but still seminal text from biology that has become a core spatial humanities and post-humanist text: Jakob von Uexküll's A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men (1934). Inga Pollmann credits Uexküll with offering a "radical transformation of perception . . . much in the way that Lewis Carroll's Alice entered Wonderland." Filled with pictures and fascinating diagrams (so be not daunted by its length!) Uexküll's "stroll" will provide much food for thought and a stimulating discussion!

    Despite much of popular and scholarly opinion, the early modern and nineteenth century Caribbean was a tri-racial world in which native people played a prominent role alongside Europeans and Africans. This paper focuses on the role played by indigenous people in mid-seventeenth century English efforts to colonize portions of the Caribbean basin. In some cases this involved war and geopolitical machinations as English, French, Kalinagos, and Africans struggled for control of different islands. On other occasions English settlers and native people, such as the Miskitos of Central America, sought to construct relationships that were mutually beneficial. Within English colonies, many free, enslaved, and visiting native people lived and labored. This native presence within English colonies shaped laws, material culture, foodways, folk traditions, economics, and health practices. Ultimately, the early modern and nineteenth century Caribbean must be understood as a space inhabited and shaped by indigenous people to an extent that most modern observers have failed to appreciate fully.
