# Spatial Humanities Working Group

Over the course of the past few decades, scholars in the humanities have increasingly used space as an analytical concept for their research. Each discipline has engaged the so-called “spatial turn” in its own way, resulting in both convergences and divergences in our areas of study. New areas of scholarly attention have ranged from the history of cartography to the metaphoric use of space in literary prose. Moreover, the introduction of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) – a technology designed for positivist lines of inquiry – to humanities research has engendered new research questions and debates. Questions of space have permeated a wide range of disciplines, yet “spatial humanities” remains a somewhat amorphous and fragmented area of inquiry. 

In light of the increased attention to space – geographical or otherwise – within the humanities, this working group aims to build connections across disciplinary boundaries. **We provide an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies.** These conversations can and have taken numerous formats, including shared discussions of readings, collective workshopping of pre-circulated works-in-progress, training sessions in GIS software, and the invitation of outside speakers. Ultimately, the goal is to develop activities around participants’ interests and to compare our diverse disciplinary trainings.

**Through these informal meetings, we are developing connections for future collaboration.** This includes shared research endeavors, common conference panels, and broad funding efforts. In addition, we hope to provide an interdisciplinary space for research feedback, especially for graduate students. Lastly, our working group serves as a hub of information for funding resources, online data, and similar projects, as well as a network of support for GIS software and related technologies. We've started to compile some useful links on our [[resources page](resources)]

The Spatial Humanities Working Group (SHWG) meets roughly once a month (usually at 1:00 in the History Department); please check our [[our schedule](schedule)]. Technical workshops will be scheduled periodically according to interests and availability. For more information, or to be added to our listserv, please contact [Jeff Erbig](mailto:erbig@unm.edu) or [Fred Gibbs](mailto:fwgibbs@unm.edu).

**THIS MONTH**: Check out the [Stories Out/In Place exhibit](http://art.unm.edu/project/stories-outin-place/) at the CFA Downtown Studio.
