      <p class="text-justify">We provide an interdisciplinary space for research feedback, for both students and faculty. Whether conceptualizing a new spatial project or polishing an existing article, our works-in-progress meetings flow naturally from our participantsâ€™ interests and provide perspectives from our diverse disciplinary trainings. Works-in-progress also include syllabi! </p>

      <p class="text-justify">By bringing together faculty from several different departments, we are much better able to recognize our mutual areas of overlap (whether geographical, theoretical, methodological, etc.) We use our meetings not only to critique and comment on each others' work, but to build collaborations between participants that will push spatial research in new directions. </p>
